# Octopus

Octopus is a scientific program allowing to describe non-equilibrium phenomena
in molecular complexes, low dimensional materials, and extended systems. In
usual applications, electrons are described quantum-mechanically within
density-functional theory (DFT), or in its time-dependent form (TDDFT) when
doing simulations in time, using a real-space grid, while nuclei are described
classically as point particles. Electromagnetic fields can be treated either
classically or quantum mechanically within a generalized time-dependent density
functional theory.

For optimal execution performance Octopus is parallelized using MPI and OpenMP
and can scale to tens of thousands of processors.  It also has support for
graphical processing units (GPUs) through CUDA and OpenCL.

## How to get Octopus

Octopus can either be built from source or installed using some packaging
format. Building from source can be done either from [tarball
archives](#build-from-tarball-archive) or directly from the [git
repository](#build-from-git-repository). For the latest releases, supported
packaging formats that we are aware of include [Spack](https://spack.io/) and
[MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/octopus/).

In the case of running Octopus in an HPC environment where performance is
critical, we recommended using an installation of the code managed by the HPC
administrators. In case a different version is needed than the one available, we
recommend getting in touch with the HPC administrators.

### Build from tarball archive

Octopus ships versioned tarball archives that can be downloaded from the
[official website](https://Octopus-code.org/documentation/main/releases/). These
have been processed wiht the autotools that you can configure-build-install
Octopus simply using:

```console
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

For more configuration details see [installation page](https://Octopus-code.org/documentation/main/manual/install/).

### Build from git repository

To build Octopus directly from the git repository, you first need to generate the build files using the autotools

```console
$ autoreconf --install
```

After that, continue with the instructions in [build from tarball archive](#build-from-tarball-archive).

## Running Octopus

The main interface of Octopus are the `inp` files. Such a file needs to be
present in the work directory for Octopus to run, after which simply run
`octopus`:

```console
$ cat inp
CalculationMode = gs
PeriodicDimensions = 3
a = 10.2
BoxShape = parallelepiped
%LatticeParameters
  a | a | a
%
%LatticeVectors
 0.  | 0.5 | 0.5

 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0

 "Si" |   1/4    | 1/4     | 1/4

%KPointsGrid

$ Octopus
```

## Test Suite

Octopus is packaged with its own application test framework and test suite. For details on how to run the tests
following successful installation, please consult `testsuite/README`.

## License

Octopus is free software, released under the GPL license version 2 or higher. You are free to download it and use it.
You can freely modify it granted you follow the license terms and respect the attributions.

Octopus includes bundled code with different compatible license. Please see [`COPYING`](COPYING) for more details.

## How to cite Octopus

Octopus is a free program, so you have the right to use, change, distribute, and
to publish papers with it without citing anyone (for as long as you follow the
GPL license). However, its considered a good scientific practice to cite one or
more paper concerning Octopus in an article that uses it. We recommend citing at
least the latest paper describing the code:
